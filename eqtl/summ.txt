Summary of analysis of 3'UTR eQTL

AIM of this study: we want to show that eQTLs identified from within 3'UTR of its associated genes are not false positives, and to reveal the genetic mechanisms for the regulatory effect of the 3'UTR eQTLs (like affecting RNA stability)

Data: 
(1),all eQTL~Gene expression association data from GTEx project (obtained via Xin He, Uchicago) for 49 tissues (7 selected for main analysis here: Brain_Cortex, Brain_Cerebellum,Kidney_Cortex, Ovary,Testis, Thyroid and Whole_Blood)
(2),Fine-mapping eQTLs with PIP score using DAPG for 49 tissues based on the eQTL~Gene expression association data from GTEx project (obtained via Gao Wang, Uchicago)
(3), RBP binding sites for 65 RBPs in HepG2 and K562 cell lines from eCLIP datasets (downloaded from Seqweaver training datasets)
(4), 3'UTR region coordinates for all human genes (downloaded from ensemble database)
(5), 48,442 3'UTR SNPs used as control to 3'UTR eQTL produced by SNPsnap webserver for matched allele frequency, gene density, and LD structure et al.

Analysis:
(1), overenrichment of 3'UTR eQTL with pip score >=0.5 (HP) within RBP binding regions:
methods: for each RBP, enrichment of HP eQTL within binding regions compared with control SNPs estimated using the fisher's exact test.

results: 
a, enrichment analysis using pool of eQTL with maximum pip score >=0.5 in any tissue  
(a table to show enrichment and p for each of 65 RBPs, along with gene function annotation)

b, enrichment analysis using eQTL with pip score >=0.5 in each tissue seperately
(a table and clustered bulb plot to show tissue specificity)

(2), overenrichment of HP eQTL within RBP binding sites predicted by deepsea
methods: ref alt differences of deepsea prediction score (reference allele) for binding probability for 73 RBPs were obtained and compared between pooled HP eQTL (pip<0.5), LP eQTL (pip<0.5) and control SNPs, prediction score cutoff of 0.1-0.5 used to check enrichment of HP eQTL for higher scores

results:
a, cumulative distribution of deepsea prediction score for HP eQTL , LP eQTL and control SNPs for different RBPs and KS-test to estimate difference significance

b, same analysis as above but for eQTL, only those within eCLIP RBP binding sites (consistent RBP between prediction and eCLIP) analyzed

(3), tissue specificity analysis of eQTL
methods: using proportion of alternative hypothesis estimates based on p value distribution to esimate true eQTL proportion in each sample, and also overlapped true eQTL between two tissues. 
Note: for tissue comparison, true eQTL were selected in A tissue based on raw p value or PIP score, and then estimate 1-pi0 based on p value distribution in tissue B.

results:
a, proportion of estimated true eQTL across different tissues and also different gene regions (promoter, exon, intron, et al.)
tables of pi1:

plot of normalized pi1 for different gene regions across tissues
res.pi1_diff
legend: each circle represent one sample for one gene regions, and the y axis represent pi1 (proportion of true eQTLs) increase compared with that for exon regionss (here, we use pi1 difference rather than original pi1 because pi1 are different betwen samples, and it is conveient to show pi1  patterns change in different tissue in the same plot) 


b, true 3UTR eQTL overlap between tissues based on pi1 estimates (here eQTL with pip score >=0.5 in tissue A were used as true ones, then pi1 estimates performed in tissue B for these eQTLs)

(4), consistence of predicted RBP binding changes  (by deepsea) for ref/alternate alleles of HP eQTL and observed eQTL-gene expression associations
method:
For each RBP, the relationship between the predicted RBP binding probability changes across all HP eQTLs vs their effect size on target gene expression were compared, 
with focus on the direction changes (like negative/positive relationship for RBP binding probability changes  from ref to alternate allele and that for gene expression level changes of target gene)
(Note, here we hypothesize that for the same RBP, its binding to different eQTLs will affect target gene expression level in the same directions across different sites)
results: out of 73 RBPs tested, we have only 5 RBPs (HNRNPK, PABP, SF3A3, SLTM, U2AF1) with clear pattern by manual pick, and 4 of them show significant eQTL over enrichment according to above analysis
